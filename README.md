# Amity-Room-Allocation Algorithm  ![Travis CI Passing](https://travis-ci.org/andela-ggikera/amity-room-allocation.svg?branch=master).

A room allocation algorithm for amity: implemented in Python.
It's eccentric. Why? because it allocates rooms at random. Random is good.

2. Install dependencies if you want to work under a sandbox

	`` pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt``

3. Test it first: (TDD is good)
