# Amity-Room-Allocation Algorithm  ![Travis CI Passing](https://travis-ci.org/andela-ggikera/amity-room-allocation.svg?branch=master)

A room allocation algorithm for amity: implemented in Python.
It's eccentric. Why? because it allocates rooms at random. Random is good.

	`` pip install -r requirements.txt``

3. Test it first: (TDD is good)
